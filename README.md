# c-Library
My default c++ library

Have:
  1. Vector functions
  2. 2d Camera
  3. 3d Camera
  4. Mesh class
  
Maybe in the future I will add:
  1. Numerical solver of differential equation of N-power
  2. UI components (like sliders, buttons, 2d/3d graphs)
  3. Shader implementation
  4. Rigidbody class
  5. Neural network and its improvements (as gpu-acceleration, aditional models)
  6. Triangulation algorithms
